    The scope of the project involved planning, designing, and constructing the entire racing track, allied roadway, and arena in Shahaniya, West Doha.

    Being a sentimental element of the Arabs, this project required intense planning and precision which was flawlessly delivered by us. Right from understanding the requirement, and throughout the construction we have substantially maintained world-class standards with an ethnic touch.

    Additionally, we take care of the maintenance of the camel race area and preparation of the track lines for racing since 2008."
